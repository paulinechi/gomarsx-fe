                disputes (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable
                relief as set forth below) in connection with the Terms or the
                use of any product or service provided by the Company that
                cannot be resolved informally or in small claims court shall be
                resolved by binding arbitration on an individual basis under the
                terms of this Arbitration Agreement. Unless otherwise agreed to,
                all arbitration proceedings shall be held in English. This
                Arbitration Agreement applies to you and the Company, and to any
                subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in
                interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or

                >(b) Notice Requirement and Informal Dispute Resolution. Before
                either party may seek arbitration, the party must first send to
                the other party a written Notice of Dispute
                (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;) describing the nature and basis of the
                claim or dispute, and the requested relief. A Notice to the
                Company should be sent to: 8171 Brittany Drive, Dublin,
                California, 94568. After the Notice is received, you and the
                Company may attempt to resolve the claim or dispute informally.
                If you and the Company do not resolve the claim or dispute
                within thirty (30) days after the Notice is received, either
                party may begin an arbitration proceeding. The amount of any
                settlement offer made by any party may not be disclosed to the
                arbitrator until after the arbitrator has determined the amount
                of the award, if any, to which either party is entitled.</span

                >(c) Arbitration Rules. Arbitration shall be initiated through
                the American Arbitration Association (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;), an
                established alternative dispute resolution provider (&ldquo;ADR
                Provider&rdquo;) that offers arbitration as set forth in this
                section. If AAA is not available to arbitrate, the parties shall
                agree to select an alternative ADR Provider. The rules of the
                ADR Provider shall govern all aspects of the arbitration,
                including but not limited to the method of initiating and/or
                demanding arbitration, except to the extent such rules are in
                conflict with the Terms. The AAA Consumer Arbitration Rules
                (&ldquo;Arbitration Rules&rdquo;) governing the arbitration are

                shall be conducted by a single, neutral arbitrator. Any claims
                or disputes where the total amount of the award sought is less
                than Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars (US $10,000.00) may be resolved
                through binding non-appearance-based arbitration, at the option
                of the party seeking relief. For claims or disputes where the
                total amount of the award sought is Ten Thousand U.S. Dollars
                (US $10,000.00) or more, the right to a hearing will be
                determined by the Arbitration Rules. Any hearing will be held in
                a location within 100 miles of your residence, unless you reside
                outside of the United States, and unless the parties agree
                otherwise. If you reside outside of the U.S., the arbitrator
                shall give the parties reasonable notice of the date, time and
                place of any oral hearings. Any judgment on the award rendered
                by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent
                jurisdiction. If the arbitrator grants you an award that is
                greater than the last settlement offer that the Company made to
                you prior to the initiation of arbitration, the Company will pay
                you the greater of the award or $2,500.00. Each party shall bear
                its own costs (including attorney&rsquo;s fees) and
                disbursements arising out of the arbitration and shall pay an
                equal share of the fees and costs of the ADR Provider.</span

                non-appearance based arbitration is elected, the arbitration
                shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or based solely on
                written submissions; the specific manner shall be chosen by the
                party initiating the arbitration. The arbitration shall not
                involve any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses

                statute of limitations (i.e., the legal deadline for filing a
                claim) and within any deadline imposed under the AAA Rules for

                arbitrator will decide the rights and liabilities, if any, of
                you and the Company, and the dispute will not be consolidated
                with any other matters or joined with any other cases or
                parties. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant
                motions dispositive of all or part of any claim. The arbitrator
                shall have the authority to award monetary damages, and to grant
                any non-monetary remedy or relief available to an individual
                under applicable law, the AAA Rules, and the Terms. The
                arbitrator shall issue a written award and statement of decision
                describing the essential findings and conclusions on which the
                award is based, including the calculation of any damages
                awarded. The arbitrator has the same authority to award relief
                on an individual basis that a judge in a court of law would
                have. The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you
                and the Company.</span

                >Entire Terms. These Terms constitute the entire agreement
                between you and us regarding the use of the Sites. Our failure
                to exercise or enforce any right or provision of these Terms
                shall not operate as a waiver of such right or provision. The
                section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have
                no legal or contractual effect. The word &ldquo;including&rdquo;
                means &ldquo;including without limitation&rdquo;. If any
                provision of these Terms is, for any reason, held to be invalid
                or unenforceable, the other provisions of these Terms will be
                unimpaired and the invalid or unenforceable provision will be
                deemed modified so that it is valid and enforceable to the
                maximum extent permitted by law. Your relationship to Company is
                that of an independent contractor, and neither party is an agent
                or partner of the other. These Terms, and your rights and
                obligations herein, may not be assigned, subcontracted,
                delegated, or otherwise transferred by you without
                Company&rsquo;s prior written consent, and any attempted
                assignment, subcontract, delegation, or transfer in violation of
                the foregoing will be null and void. Company may freely assign
                these Terms. The terms and conditions set forth in these Terms
                shall be binding upon assignees.</span
